# Nexus of the Architects GDD


You stumbled upon the nexus city of an ancient group, only known as the architects.

Throughout the surrounding areas you find terminals with bits and pieces of ancient wisdom.

Your exploration gives you the power needed to solve this mystery.

What awaits?

## Core gameplay loop

You solve various situations through using your platforming abilities to progress.

Defeating enemies yield either scrap or biomass.

The player has a number of heart containers filled with health (can be increased by finding heart pieces).
When he gets hit by an enemy, he loses health.

When the players health reaches 0, he spawns back at the nexus, but loses all carried biomass and scrap.

Scrap can be used as currency when bartering with vendors, or for certain story related unlocks.
For instance, fixing the elevator in the nexus requires 400 scrap to unlock the upper nexus level.

Biomass can be used to upgrade your characters innate abilities.


## Collectables

Scrap and biomass drops as physical entities by killing enemies.
Heart pieces and power upgrades are typically found in chests.
